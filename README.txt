Tower Defense: Road to GraduationAidan Carroll, Andrew Elenbogen, Alex Calamaro, Jerry Wei	The goal of our game is to create towers that will fire at enemies to kill them before they reach the end of the path. Enemies spawn at the top left corner and proceed along the path to the graduation hat in the bottom right. If they manage to reach the graduation hat, you lose a life.    To add a tower you click and drag each of the icons in the second menu on the right. Before choosing your first tower, click on the button to see a brief description of the special abilities of each tower.  Note each tower costs money. You can only earn money by killing the enemies. 	Once you have placed your first tower, hit the start level button. Enemies should start to appear. If you wish to pause the game, there is a pause button next to the start level button.	You win the game if you complete level 8. You loose if you run out of lives. Currently there are no known bugs to our code. However, the game is very poorly balanced (it is way too easy). Because everything is done dynamically it is easy to rebalance, however it takes a large amount of testing and time. To balance you only need to change variables in the constructor of the tower and enemy subclasses.
